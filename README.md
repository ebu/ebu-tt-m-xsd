[Tech3390](https://tech.ebu.ch/publications/tech3390).

* Copyright 2019, EBU, www.ebu.ch
* Version of XML Schema: 0.9
* Creation: 24/05/2019

The publication of this EBU-TT XML Schema for EBU-TT Metadata is intended to support the 
implementation of the specification in EBU-Tech 3390 version 1.0.

Please note that the EBU-TT XML Schema is a helping document and NOT normative but informative.

## Style Guide

The `use` attribute should only be specified when its value is `required` - in all other
cases the default `optional` value applies and does not need to be specified.
